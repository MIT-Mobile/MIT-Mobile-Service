MIT Mobile Service 2.1 is the device detection portion of the MIT Mobile Framework. It is required for regular use of the MIT Mobile Web, but can also act as a stand alone service for websites which need to classify visitors into mobile and desktop users.

MIT Mobile Service is open source software created, maintained, and shared under the MIT license by Information Services & Technology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

A better README is forthcoming.
